MATLAB code for "Numerical methods for the 2nd moment of stochastic ODEs" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02164)).

The path to `ppfem/lib/` should be made known to MATLAB using e.g. `addpath('path-to/ppfem/lib/');`. 

Note that the [curvefit toolbox](https://mathworks.com/help/curvefit/) is required.

Run `main_mul_compute` and optionally, upon completion, `main_mul_plot`.

Tested with MATLAB 8.6.0.267246 (R2015b).
